# Weather App Project

##Overview
This is the third project of Front-end Udacity Nanodegree for me. This project is about building an asynchronous web app that does Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI with weather data and their given response in the text field. 
Udacity gives me permission to use OpenWeatherMap API only, so it only runs with zip codes from the USA.

This is a Weather Application that allows users to get the actual weather from a place using the zip code from this place.

## How to start

You require to have Node.js and npm locally installed. You can check that by running `node -v && npm -v` in terminal. This should result in two versions shown in the terminal.

Then, you have to run `npm start` in order to run the express server locally.

Open `localhost:8080`in your browser and the app will be running.
